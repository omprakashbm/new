              COVID19 has hit us hard, hundreds of people are dying on a daily basis from lack of ICU beds, Oxygen Supply and many others deprived of oxygen lying in the corridors of hospitals. Lots of Organizations, Alliances, Government Agencies, Groups are bringing the right tools and technologies to save people's lives. It has been reported that the Oxygen Plants, Concentrators, Ventilators and other biomedical equipment are coming to Nepal but without after sales support. Furthermore, lack of technicians is stopping the use of those life-saving devices.

              As per Dr. Shishir, Bir Hospital during Innotalk #4 shared, â€œ For the preparation of the 3rd wave, hospital administration should be able to update with technologies and must be able to use them when necessary for biomedical tools and technologies. In Nepal, there was a shortage of oxygen, crisis production was tight but the main problem lay in real time oxygen mapping and management. Also with doctors, machines are saving lives and like the human body, they also need care and maintenance. So biomedical engineers are a must for this country and engineers and doctors need to collaborate now. For the 3rd wave, hospitals should step up and push the administration hard for next level preparation in this through digital push.

            To fight these challenges, Robotics Association of Nepal [RAN], Biotechnology Society of Nepal [BSN] and Biomedical Engineering Foundation Nepal [BEFN] are working together as a Mission Oxygen Team [MOT] with Nepal Biomedical Association [NBA] as a supporting organization where we are recruiting Engineers with Biomedical background or have previously worked on Biomedical devices to install, operate, maintain and operate the Oxygen facilities all over Nepal as we three organization together would mobilize the members and other interested volunteers to solve these existing challenge. We have established Memorandum of Understanding [MoU] with Non-Resident Nepali Associations, Nepal Ventilators Banks, Pawan BioScientific Engineering Services, Sagarmatha Biomedical Engineering Service Concern Pvt. Ltd.  and Nepal Health Equipment Development Foundation [NHEDF].

              The team is in its early stage as we are training our volunteers/members on these devices. We hope to equip ourselves with knowledge on this device and be able to support the Healthcare system. We are targeting to reach up to 90% utilization of all oxygen and biomedical related equipment throughout Nepal.
